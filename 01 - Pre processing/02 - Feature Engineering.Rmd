+ Can have a significant impact on model performance.

+ Using combinations of perdictors can be more effective than individual values.

+ Most effective when encoding is informed by the modellers understanding of the problem as 
opposed to dervived by a mathematical technique.

+ Some encodings will work better for some models.

+ In some models multiple encodings of the same data cause problems.

+ Relationship between predictor and outcome is important.

## Techniques

### Ratios

Using the ratio of two predictors may work better.

### Dates

+ The number of days since a reference date.
+ Isolating the month, year and day of week.
+ The numeric data of the year.
+ Whether the date was within a school year vs. holiday, summer sessions.
+ A seasonal component might be best modelled by day of year or month of year.
